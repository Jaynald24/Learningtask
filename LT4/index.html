				<p class="p1"><mark> A third and shorter narrative poem,Â A Lover's Complaint, was printed in the first collection of Shakespeare's sonnets. 
					Most scholars agree now that it was also written by Shakespeare, though that was contested for some time. 
					The poem tells the story of a young woman who is driven to misery by a persuasive suitor's attempts to seduce her. 
					It is not regarded by critics to be his finest work.</mark></p>
